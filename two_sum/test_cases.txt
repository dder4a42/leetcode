# Test Cases Format:
# - Input lines (one or more)
# - "---" separator line
# - Expected Answer (Python literal - e.g., 9, "[0,1]", "[[1,2],[1,4]]")
# - Blank line separator between test cases
#
# Each input line becomes an argument to solve() method.

# Example 1: Single line input (traditional)
2 7 11 15
---
[0, 1]

# Example 2: Two line input (e.g., Two Sum with separate target)
[2, 7, 11, 15]
9
---
[0, 1]

# Example 3: Complex input with multiple lines
nums1 = [1,7,11]
nums2 = [2,4,6]
k = 3
---
[[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6]]

# Example 4: Matrix input
3
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
---
[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
