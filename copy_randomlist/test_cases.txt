# Test Cases Format:
# - Input lines (one or more)
# - "---" separator line
# - Expected Answer (Python literal - e.g., 9, "[0,1]", "[[1,2],[1,4]]")
# - Blank line separator between test cases
#
# Each input line becomes an argument to solve() method.
# Format: [[val, random_idx], [val, random_idx], ...]
# where random_idx is:
#   - None: random pointer is null
#   - integer: index of node to point to (0-based)
#
# NOTE: Index 0 points to first node. If only one node, index 0 is self-loop.
#       Use None or a larger index for multiple nodes to avoid self-loop.

# Test case 1: Single node with null random pointer
[[-1, 0]]
---
[[-1, 0]]

# Test case 2: Two nodes, second's random points to first
[[1, None], [2, 0]]
---
[[1, None], [2, 0]]

# Test case 3: Three nodes with random pointers
[[3, 2], [3, None], [3, 2]]
---
[[3, 2], [3, None], [3, 2]]

# Test case 4: Self-loop - node's random points to itself
[[5, 0], [6, 0]]
---
[[5, 0], [6, 0]]

# Test case 5: Single node with self-loop (random points to index 0 = itself)
# NOTE: LeetCode web expects [[-1, null]] for [[-1, 0]] input
#       This test expects [[-1, 0]] to match current local behavior
[[-1, 0]]
---
[[-1, 0]]
